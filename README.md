# java-from-zero
This is my personal journey of learning Java from scratch. <br>
It includes notes, exercises, and mini projects based on tutorials (like Bro Code) and books.<br>


## 📁 Structure <br>
- `Week-01`: Variables, Data Types, Input/Output <br>
- `Week-02`: Conditionals, Loops <br>
- `Week-03`: Methods, Arrays <br>
- `Notes`: Written explanations and summaries <br>


## 📚 Resources I'm learning from
- [Bro Code - Java Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk4_1vDrzzo)  <br>
- "Java Programming" - Book <br>
- [w3schools Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) <br>

## 🚀 Goal
Learn Java well enough to build real applications and get hired as a Java Developer before moving to Norway in late 2026.
